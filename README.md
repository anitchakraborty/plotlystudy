Exploration Notebook - Kickstarter

- Introduction 
In this notebook, I'll try to explore the characteristics of Kickstarter projects. Before we dive deep into the data, let us know a little more about Kickstarter.

This Kickstarter dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q0bxHVsNlUOU5suxGj2MULeUzPCbJYmh).

- What is Kickstarter?

Kickstarter PBC is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others.

Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.

- What are the basics?

A project is a finite work with a clear goal that youâ€™d like to bring to life. Think albums, books, or films. The funding goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project.

A creator is the person or team behind the project idea, working to bring it to life.

Backers are folks who pledge money to join creators in bringing projects to life.
